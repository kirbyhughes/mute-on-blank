macOS does not provide a way to mute the volume when the screen blanks after inactivity.

You can do that with this python script along with using cron (which will probably be removed from macos someday).


# You need a working python3, in your path, with:
# pip3 install pyobjc-framework-Quartz
# or
# pip3 install pyobjc (if you want all of pyObjC)

# You need a screen session named "locked"
screen -S locked

# and then this crontab entry (replace $USER with your username and make sure the path is correct)
*/10 * * * * screen -S locked -p 0 -X stuff "/Users/$USER/dev/mute/locked^M"
# make sure that is a carriage return at the end there
